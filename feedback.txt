Assignment name is: Project 1 - Variable Length Coding


What did I learn?

	I learned more about several aspects of memory management in C, as well as the
	first and last characters in ASCII.  I also learned how to print hexadecimal
	values in c and where to put the CLIBFLAGS when compiling.


What was easy about this assignment?

	Setting up most of the methods was pretty easy.  Having done the same assignment
	(without needing to implement the heap) in java I knew what needed to be done.


What gave you problems/troubles?

	Figuring out how to write the solution in C.  When I did it in java I had
	little trouble.


What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?

	Some more documentation would be very helpful.  Also, adding a suggestion of
	what to start with when working on the assignment would be extremely helpful
	(not just for this assignment, but for every assignment in the entirety of CS).


What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

	To do it in java instead.
